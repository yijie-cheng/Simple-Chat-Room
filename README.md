# Simple Chat Room

## Requirements
- Ensure you have MongoDB installed. Copy your MongoDB connection string into the file named `.env.defaults` and rename the file to `.env`.

## Quick Start
To run the Simple Chat Room application, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies for the frontend:
    ```shell
    cd frontend
    yarn
    ```

2. Install dependencies for the backend:
    ```shell
    cd ../backend
    yarn
    ```

3. Start the backend server:
    ```shell
    yarn server
    ```

4. In a new terminal, start the frontend application:
    ```shell
    cd frontend
    yarn start
    ```

These commands will set up both the frontend and backend parts of the application.
